# CollegeSearch
An iOS app to present information about a wide variety of educational institutions.

## Credits
- Institution data is from the National Center for Education Statistics' [IPEDS database](https://nces.ed.gov/ipeds/use-the-data).
- I used dehesa's [CodableCSV](https://github.com/dehesa/CodableCSV) library.

## Caveats
The data shown in the app is hardcoded, and not gathered by any sort of API at runtime. It was the most current data available in the IPEDS database as of December 21, 2020.

This app was simply a personal project. I may or may not maintain and update it with newer data in the future. Please keep this in mind if you choose to use this app yourself.
